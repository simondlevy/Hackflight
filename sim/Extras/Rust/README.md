## About
This directory contains code to run a server to control hackflight sim using Rust and sockets. 

This repository is heavily based on the python implementation of the servers from the original HackflightSim found [here](https://github.com/simondlevy/MulticopterSim/tree/master/Extras/python).

##NOTE
I have not tested this code yet. I am still working on getting HackflightSim to work before I can test it out. The server probably doesn't work yet

## Purpose
This was written both as personal practice for me to write stuff in Rust but also as a way to support the transition of robotics, drones, and other embedded systems to Rust as I believe that Rust is the future for system traditionally written in C/C++.
