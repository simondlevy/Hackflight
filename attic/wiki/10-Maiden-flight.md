Here's the completed vehicle, ready for its maiden flight:

We used:

* [Four-inch cable ties](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002GX1XA/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
to secure the motor wires
* Clear [0.5" heat-shrink tubing](https://www.mcmaster.com/#7856K17) to secure the motors
* Double-sided [VHB tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XIMFZVQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to 
secure the receiver
* [3/4" Velcro tape](https://www.amazon.com/VELCRO-Brand-Thin-Fasteners-Tape/dp/B00006RSWT) to secure the battery 
to the bottom of the vehicle

Using one color of [propeller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSIB7WC/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for the front of the vehicle and another for the back helps you see the vehicle's orientation in flight.  Note also
the pitch of each propeller: the <i>leading edge</i> (high edge of the blade) of each propeller points in the
direction it will spin to create lift.

Once you've connected the battery to the LadybugFC and placed the vehicle on
the ground, you can arm the board by moving the throttle to its lowest position, then flipping down the Auxiliary Switch 2.  Disarming by flipping Aux2 back up.
