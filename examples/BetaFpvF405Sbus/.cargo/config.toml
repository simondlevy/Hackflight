  # Previously, the linker arguments --nmagic and -Tlink.x were set here.
  # They are now set by build.rs instead. The linker argument can still
  # only be set here, if a custom linker is needed.

  # By default, the LLD linker is used, which is shipped with the Rust
  # toolchain. If you run into problems with LLD, you can switch to the
  # GNU linker by uncommenting this line:
  # "-C", "linker=arm-none-eabi-ld",

  # If you need to link to pre-compiled C libraries provided by a C toolchain
  # use GCC as the linker by uncommenting the three lines below:
  # "-C", "linker=arm-none-eabi-gcc",
  # "-C", "link-arg=-Wl,-Tlink.x",
  # "-C", "link-arg=-nostartfiles",
